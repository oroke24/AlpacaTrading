                    Analyze the recent performance of these stocks (with price and percent_change included): {stocks}.
                    In around 200 words, explain which stocks to keep or remove and why. 
                    Include up to 1â€“2 additional stocks you think are strong buys if you are >90% sure and under {buying_power}.

                    Then, based on that reasoning, return ONLY valid JSON (on a new line):
                    - Array of objects with at least "symbol", "price", "percent_change"
                    - Other fields can be 0 or "n/a"
                    - Only include stocks worth buying with a trailing stop of 4-8%
                    - Use double quotes for all keys and string values
                    - Do not include explanations, markdown, or notes outside the JSON
                    - If none qualify, return []
                    - Sort by highest recommended

                    Format strictly as:
