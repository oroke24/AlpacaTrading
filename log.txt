openAi's Stock list:
My take based on the metrics you provided (price action, P/B, market cap, float rotation):

- Remove: GMHS — +68% spike with very high float rotation (~13) and microcap size (~$101M) points to speculative churn. P/B >3 with that volatility raises dilution/mean‑reversion risk.

- Keep: WOOF — Value support near book (P/B ~0.98) and low float rotation (~0.26) suggest less froth. Recent +23% bounce with $1.1B cap gives better liquidity and potential turnaround asymmetry; monitor margins/leverage.

- Keep: NEO — Constructive momentum (+21.8%) with reasonable P/B (~1.32) and very low float rotation (~0.08) implies accumulation rather than a blow‑off. $1.13B cap provides sturdier footing than microcaps.

No additions: I’m not >90% confident on other names without your exact filters and live data.

Risk note: For WOOF/NEO, consider staggered exits or stops to protect gains; for GMHS, avoid averaging up after a parabolic move.

openAi's Stock list:
Quick take (no live news feed in this chat; please verify the latest headlines before acting):

- GMHS: +68% with ~13x float rotation screams low‑float squeeze. At ~$101M cap and ~3.2x P/B, the move looks sentiment-driven unless backed by a confirmed, revenue-bearing catalyst (e.g., finalized M&A, major contract, FDA clearance). High risk of giveback. Remove/trim.

- WOOF (Petco): Rebased near ~1x book, recent bounce (+23%) likely on turnaround optimism (cost actions, vet services mix). Still leveraged and competing with CHWY, but any stabilization in comps and margin mix can re-rate shares from depressed levels. Keep, position-sized, and reassess post-next earnings/credit update.

- NEO (NeoGenomics): Oncology diagnostics with secular tailwinds; ~1.3x P/B and modest float rotation imply less “hot money,” more execution risk. If recent prints show mid-teens revenue growth and margin progress, risk/reward is attractive into a multi-year recovery; reimbursement remains the key swing factor. Keep if you can be patient; otherwise hold a starter.

Adds I’m >90% confident belong on the radar:
- CHWY: Cleaner pet e‑commerce story with improving FCF and sticky Autoship; benefits if Pet category stabilizes.
- PETQ (PetIQ): Pet meds/services exposure with improving profitability; complementary to WOOF’s store-based model.

Bottom line: Remove/trim GMHS; keep WOOF and NEO with risk controls. Confirm the newest headlines/catalysts before execution.

SITC, $9.11, -25.81% -- pb_ratio: 0.98, mCap: 479.31M, float_rotation: 0.02
openAi's Stock list:
Quick take on SITC

- Ticker/company: SITC is SITE Centers, a U.S. open‑air shopping center REIT.
- Recent performance: Your data show a sharp drop (-25.8%) and a small-ish market cap (~$479M) at $9.11. That market-cap is far below where SITC historically sat, which raises a flag that a corporate action (spin-off, asset sale, special dividend, ticker/structure change) may be distorting the quote. Float rotation (~2%) also signals thin liquidity.
- Valuation: P/B ~0.98 is near book, but REITs are better judged on FFO/NOI and debt ladder. Without clear catalysts, a small-cap retail REIT with negative momentum and low liquidity carries unfavorable risk/reward.

News/context check: I can’t live-browse, but given the size mismatch and drawdown, verify whether a recent spin-off, special dividend, or reorganization occurred. If the drop is purely operational (guidance cut, tenant stress, refinancing risk), that’s more concerning.

Decision
- Remove for now: Trend is down, liquidity is low, and the structure/news picture looks unclear. Revisit only if you confirm the drawdown is due to a non-fundamental corporate action and the balance sheet/refi schedule are manageable into 2025 rate cuts.

Optional adds (if you want the theme with lower idiosyncratic risk)
- KIM (Kimco Realty): Large, grocer-anchored REIT with better liquidity and balance sheet depth.
- REG (Regency Centers): High-quality open-air portfolio; historically resilient operations.

Before acting, double-check any SITC corporate actions in the last quarter.

openAi's Stock list:
Quick take (no live news feed; based on your data, price action vs 50/200‑day averages, balance sheets, and company context through late‑2024):

- ERAS (Erasca) — Keep (with patience). Price 1.38 sits below the 50d (1.50) and 200d (1.73), so momentum is weak and it dropped 14% today. However, cash and short‑term investments (~$298M at YE’24) versus a ~$390M market cap and modest debt imply substantial net cash and a P/B ~1.0. That gives valuation support and runway for RAS/MAPK programs. Float rotation is low, so it’s not a squeeze play; it’s a cash‑backed catalyst hold. Risk: typical biotech binary outcomes and potential delays.

- CADL (Candel Therapeutics) — Remove/Reduce. Price 4.93 is below both the 50d (5.96) and 200d (6.41) with a –15.8% day, signaling weak trend. Despite ~$103M cash (YE’24), P/B ~3.0 and EV materially above net assets leave less downside cushion than ERAS. Historical 2024 data readouts drove volatility; absent fresh, clearly positive updates, risk/reward skews worse than ERAS, and dilution risk remains.

Adds (under $22.31): None. I’m not >90% sure on current prices without live quotes, so I won’t force an add.

Bottom line: Keep ERAS for cash support and potential catalysts; remove/reduce CADL due to weaker trend and richer valuation vs book. Reassess both on next clinical or partnership updates.

openAi's Stock list:
Quick take (not investment advice; based on the data you provided and recent themes):

- Likely trim/exit candidates
  - NFE: −36% and breaking the 52‑week low; very high leverage (~$9.5B debt vs ~$0.43B mkt cap). Headlines look macro, not company‑specific, but balance‑sheet risk and momentum are poor.
  - CNF (CNFinance): −29% on thin liquidity; sizable short‑term borrowings and regulatory/credit overhang for China consumer finance. Weak trend.
  - SUPV, BBAR (Argentina banks): −20%+ each; ultra‑low P/Bs are distorted by inflation/FX; sector selling tied to Argentina macro/policy uncertainty. Unless you want AR exposure, risk/reward skews negative near term.
  - EDN (Edenor): Utility with tariff/policy risk in Argentina; downtrend intact; leverage/funding needs make it sensitive to headlines.

- Potential keeps/monitors
  - LDI (loanDepot): +27.5% breakout above its prior 52‑week high (3.22). Beneficiary of rate‑cut hopes and mortgage volume beta. Still highly levered (~$3.9B net debt), so watch follow‑through around earnings and rates.
  - GGAL (Galicia): Best‑in‑class AR financial with stronger liquidity vs peers; if you want any Argentina exposure, this is typically the relative‑quality pick, but macro remains the swing factor.

- Two under‑$37.51 ideas to research (not recommendations)
  - PFE (Pfizer): Defensive, cash‑generative; trades well under $37.51 with a yield; catalysts from pipeline updates.
  - F (Ford): Under $37.51; product cycle and cost discipline help, though cyclical and EV transition are risks.

If you prefer momentum + balance‑sheet strength, prioritize LDI/GGAL for monitoring and de‑emphasize the rest.

openAi's Stock list:
Quick read on recent action and news:
- LDI (-16% today): Spiked recently on falling-rate hopes and a Citron “Trump-linked housing” long call. Balance sheet is highly levered (>$4.3B total debt, negative tangible book). 10-day volume >3x 3-month shows hot money. Verdict: Keep only as a speculative housing-rate beta; otherwise Trim/Remove due to leverage and cyclicality.
- FCEL (+23%): Pop into/around earnings. Long-term trend remains down (200DMA > price). Chronic losses and dilution risk; low P/B can be a value trap for capital-intensive alt‑energy. Cash ~$148M vs debt ~$156M post reverse split. Verdict: Remove; rally looks event-driven with weak fundamentals.
- PACS (-32%): Hit by CFO resignation; heavy lease/debt load is typical for SNFs but still a risk. Sharp technical breakdown (near/new lows, below 50/200DMAs). Demographic tailwinds help long term, but governance overhang now. Verdict: Remove/Watch; revisit after new CFO and stabilization.
- PESI (-25%): Microcap environmental/nuclear-waste services. Volatile on contract timing, but balance sheet is clean (low debt, solid cash). Secular demand from DOE/cleanup persists. Verdict: Keep (small size); fundamentals are better than the selloff implies.

Net: Keep — PESI (small), LDI (only if you want speculative housing exposure). Remove — FCEL, PACS for now.

No new adds under $44.06 I’m >90% confident in today without fresh catalysts. Consider revisiting defensives after upcoming macro prints. Not investment advice.

openAi's Stock list:
- Keep/Buy BITF: Strong 15.3% move with 10-day volume above 3-month average suggests accumulation. Price is well above both the 50-day ($1.20) and 200-day ($1.26) averages, indicating a momentum uptrend. Balance sheet shows meaningful liquidity (cash/STI ~$147M + other STI ~$87M). Use a 6% trailing stop to manage miner volatility.
- Speculative Buy BTBT: Up 4.8%; trading above the 200-day ($2.87) but just below the 50-day ($3.02). Reclaim of 50-day could accelerate. Adequate cash (~$98M). Position smaller with a 5% trailing stop given less convincing momentum than BITF.
- Avoid CPOP: Illiquid microcap spike (+15.6%) with very low cash and weak balance sheet—high fade risk.
- Avoid HLLY: -16.8% on secondary offering; heavy leverage and negative tangible book; wait for offering to clear and a base.
- Avoid IMAB: -25.7% gap despite analyst initiation; biotech event risk high—wait for stabilization above key MAs.
- Hold/Watch CLSK, MARA: Quality miners but not compelling entries today versus BITF risk/reward; consider on pullbacks or MA strength.
- No additional sub-$5.89 names meet a >90% conviction threshold today.

openAi's Stock list:
Most names here are crypto miners; momentum and volume are your best near-term signals. Keep/add BITF: it’s breaking out above both the 50- and 200-day averages (1.20/1.26) on rising 10-day volume versus 3-month, with the strongest daily move (+10.9%). BTBT also trends above its 200-day (2.87) and near the 50-day (3.02), with constructive +7% day and reasonable valuation (P/B ~1.36); it’s a lower-priced way to ride the same theme. CLSK shows solid momentum (+5%), sits near long-term support (200-day ~10.10), and carries a strong liquidity profile (>$550M cash/STI), offering a higher-quality miner exposure. MARA is more volatile, but it remains above long-term averages with improving breadth; debt is high, so use a tighter trailing stop.

Remove/avoid CAN despite today’s bounce: it’s under $1, below its 200-day (1.21), with weaker recent volume versus 3-month—elevated delisting/reverse-split risk. Avoid IMAB after a -26% gap-down; despite a Buy initiation, the tape signals event risk and poor near-term sentiment.

Use 4–8% trailing stops to respect volatility: ~6–7% for miners, ~5% for MARA given leverage. No additional sub-$9.35 “>90% conviction” picks are added today.

openAi's Stock list:
- Keep BITF: Strong momentum (price above 50D and 200D averages: 1.20/1.26 vs 1.77), rising 10-day volume vs 3-month average, solid liquidity (cash and ST investments ~ $147M vs debt ~$23M), and reasonable P/B (~1.5). Trailing stop 7% to respect volatility.
- Keep BTBT: Above 200D (2.87) and near 50D (3.02), positive day and improving participation. Balance sheet is healthy (cash ~$95M vs debt ~$14M) with modest P/B (~1.36). Trailing stop 6%.
- Keep MARA: Sector leader with scale; price near key moving averages (around 16.6), positive day, and high liquidity (~$392M cash). While leverage is higher, TBV is strong and beta to BTC can drive upside. Trailing stop 6%.
- Remove CAN: Sub-$1 penny with persistent downtrend (below 200D), risk of volatility/delisting outweighs P/B value.
- Remove IMAB: -25% day on headline; biotech event risk high despite cash; wait for stabilization.
- Remove RAPP: Large secondary at $26 created supply overhang; price below offer suggests weak sponsorship near term—avoid until post-deal price action stabilizes.

openAi's Stock list:
- Keep/Buy BITF (1.74, +8.75%): Best momentum setup. Price is above both 50D (1.20) and 200D (1.26) with rising 10D volume vs 3M, and strong float rotation—signals accumulation. Reasonable P/B (1.46). Use a tight trailing stop due to crypto beta.
- Keep/Buy BTBT (2.97, +6.06%): Price above 200D (2.87) and reclaiming 50D (3.02). Momentum improving, though 10D volume lags 3M; position smaller than BITF. P/B 1.35 keeps valuation in check.
- Hold/Avoid adding MARA (16.28, +1.88%): Price near 50D/200D with heavy net debt; momentum is tepid versus peers. Prefer miners with better relative strength (BITF).
- Remove CAN (0.74, +4.79%): Under 200D (1.21) with weak recent volume and minimal float rotation—bounce risk without confirmation.
- Remove IMAB (3.46, -24.78%): Large drawdown despite positive coverage; biotech event risk and soft recent volume—avoid until base forms.
No additional sub-$4.76 tickers meet a >90% conviction threshold beyond BITF/BTBT from this list.

openAi's Stock list:
- Keep/Buy: BITF and HIVE—both reclaimed and are holding above 50/200-day averages with rising volume and reasonable P/B (1.7 and 1.3). Strong crypto beta gives upside if BTC strength persists; use wider trailing stops due to volatility. CNC—value plus momentum: large-cap payer with P/B ~0.63, big cash/short-term investments, and a decisive break above the 50-DMA suggests a trend reversal; stop tighter than miners.
- Remove/Pass: CAN—sub-$1, below 200-DMA, microcap risk. LDI—huge squeeze (+19%) but leverage is heavy (net debt ~$3.9B) and negative tangible equity; fragile rally. AENT—illiquid microcap, post-earnings gap down and low cash; poor risk/reward. ACHR—below 50/200-DMAs; story equity with deteriorating momentum. MARA—below 50/200-DMAs; prefer stronger crypto momentum (BITF/HIVE). DOW—cyclical chemical name below 200-DMA; setup is mixed.
- No additional “>90% sure” sub-11.63 picks today.

openAi's Stock list:
CDLX: Momentum is news-driven (AmEx/Citron), but fundamentals are fragile: negative tangible book, sizable debt and small-cap volatility with very high recent rotation. Good for traders, not for a risk-aware buy-and-hold. Remove.

LDI: Rate-sensitive mortgage originator with heavy leverage (total debt >$4.3B), negative tangible book, and today’s drawdown on elevated volume. The risk/reward isn’t compelling at this PB and leverage. Remove.

MARA: Sector leader but carries meaningful net debt (~$2.05B). While PB is lowest of the group, balance sheet risk is nontrivial versus peers. Prefer to wait for de-risking or better entry. Watch, not a buy now.

BITF: Strong momentum (10-day volume >> 3-month), modest debt, solid liquidity (cash/STI ~ $147M + $87M), and improving trend near 52-week highs. Among miners, its balance sheet quality and price action look best. Keep/Buy with a tight trailing stop.

CLSK: Healthy cash and short-term investments (~$554M), reasonable valuation (PB ~1.8), and sustained uptrend above 50/200-day averages. Operational execution and liquidity make it a higher-quality miner pick. Keep/Buy with a tight trailing stop.

No additional sub-$1.77 “>90% conviction” ideas today that meet the constraint and our confidence threshold.

openAi's Stock list:
Keep crypto miners with momentum and constructive positioning above key averages: BITF, CLSK, MARA, and BTBT. They trade above (or near) 50/200-day averages, have improving liquidity, and benefit from sector beta; use wider trailing stops due to volatility. AG (silver miner) shows strong trend confirmation (price > 50/200D, rising volume) with manageable debt and cash; it’s a quality metals beta play. WRD screens compelling on value (P/B ~0.56), very strong liquidity (large cash/ST investments), and a reclaim of the 200D—risk/reward favors accumulation with a tighter stop.

Remove/avoid: CAN (sub-$1, below 200D, deteriorating trend; cyclical ASIC exposure), CDLX (negative tangible book, high net debt, breakdown day with heavy volume), CSAN (very high leverage, -21% gap below MAs), HOUS (+58% spike against heavy net debt; prone to mean reversion and data inconsistencies), BKKT (thin float, extreme rotation/squeeze behavior; poor risk control post-spike). No additional off-list “>90% sure” buys under 17.96.

openAi's Stock list:
Keep/accumulate the crypto infrastructure leaders with stronger balance sheets and clear uptrends: BITF and CLSK. Both trade above their 50/200-day averages with strong volume; BITF has modest debt and cash on hand, while CLSK holds substantial liquidity, offering better risk-adjusted exposure than peers. Use 5–7% trailing stops to respect volatility.

Trim/avoid MARA despite scale; leverage is notably higher, which magnifies drawdowns versus BITF/CLSK. HIVE is improving operationally, but today’s large draw and headline-driven moves argue for waiting on a higher-low setup before adding.

LAC broke out on strategic-interest headlines and trades above key moving averages; lithium sentiment tailwinds support a starter position, but keep risk tight given policy/news risk.

IAS shows a constructive trend above its moving averages, and the merger framework/termination-fee structure offers some downside guard; it’s a steadier add with a tight stop.

Avoid/exit CAN and CPOP (low quality, high churn), DOUG and PEPG (event-driven spikes prone to retracement), RIG (dilution overhang plus heavy leverage), and AMPY (extended after a one-day surge). No additional >90% conviction sub-37.21 names to add today.

openAi's Stock list:
- Keep/Buy BITF: Pullback with Bitcoin weakness, but balance sheet is solid (low debt, good liquidity) and price still above 50/200D averages. Attractive risk/reward among miners. Use tight stop.
- Keep/Buy LAC: Significant cash vs modest debt, leverage to lithium upcycle, and still below recent highs. Volatility is high; position with a disciplined stop.
- Buy PEPG selectively: Biotech with strong cash runway and limited liabilities; recent selloff looks like an overreaction after a big run and a raised PT. Binary risk remains, so size small and use wider stop.
- Avoid/Remove CDLX: Spike driven by headlines, but negative tangible book and high net debt make the rebound fragile.
- Avoid/Remove HFFG: Cheap on P/B but leverage is high, liquidity thin; drawdown could extend.
- Avoid for now MARA/CLSK: Crypto beta without clear near-term tailwind; MARA’s leverage and CLSK’s new credit facility increase risk into BTC volatility.

openAi's Stock list:
Momentum and positioning favor Bitcoin-exposed miners: BITF, CLSK, and MARA are trading above both 50- and 200-day averages with strong liquidity and rising volumes, supporting follow-through. Use 5–6% trailing stops to manage crypto volatility. Among sub-$3.11 names, GRWG has a clean breakout above both 50/200-day averages and improving trend; a 6–7% trailing stop is prudent. ZURA’s balance sheet is cash-rich with no debt and price now above key averages; despite high rotation, its downside is buffered by cash—use an 8% stop. CAN is a speculative add: price reclaimed the 50-day but remains below the 200-day; treat as a momentum catch-up with an 8% stop.

Remove/avoid: MLTX (-89%) and LRMR (-33%) on trial/program risks and broken trends; CLLS (-20%) shows weakness and event risk; LAC is liquid and above long-term averages but today’s drawdown and commodity cyclicality reduce near-term edge; CGC’s pop occurs amid leverage and sector headwinds—better as a tactical trade than a buy-and-hold. No additional >90% conviction sub-$3.11 names to add today.

openAi's Stock list:
Keep crypto miners BITF, CLSK, and MARA. All trade above their 50/200-day averages with 10-day volume outpacing 3-month averages, signaling institutional accumulation; use 5–7% trailing stops given crypto volatility. Keep AG: silver momentum persists and shares sit well above 50/200-day averages; a 5% trailing stop fits a trending metals name. Keep LAC: still above key moving averages despite today’s pullback; momentum from last week remains intact—use ~6% trailing stop. IMAB shows improving trend (above 50/200DMA) with a solid cash position; biotech volatility warrants a wider 7–8% stop.

Remove/avoid: CGC (regulatory overhang and -9% day), BTBT (convertible notes/dilution near 50DMA), AMBC (-17% on acquisition uncertainty), MLTX (capitulation far below long-term averages), ZURA (chase risk after +30% spike), and CAN (sub-$1, below 200DMA; speculative with higher downside risk). No additional sub-$49.23 names meet a >90% conviction threshold today.

openAi's Stock list:
Crypto miners are rallying, but quality and balance-sheet strength matter. Keep CLSK: it’s a scale leader with solid liquidity (over $550M cash + short-term investments), still near mid-range of its 52-week band, and showing strong momentum above 50/200-DMAs. Keep BITF: under $3.61 with improving trend, solid cash/short-term investments, and favorable momentum vs moving averages—use a wider stop given volatility. Remove CAN: sub-$1 with headline-driven spike and dilution/China risk; the pop could fade. Remove HIVE: lagging momentum versus peers and smaller scale. MARA is liquid and moving, but leverage/dilution risk is higher than CLSK; prefer CLSK/BITF exposure. Keep AES: a defensive utility with a clean breakout above 50/200-DMAs, improving sentiment in renewables/utilities, and manageable valuation; it diversifies crypto beta. Remove RUN: strong move but very high debt in a still-rate-sensitive solar model—risk of reversals. Remove LAC: DOE funding de-risks long-term, but today’s drop and evolving structure create event risk; wait for stabilization. No additional sub-$3.61 names meet a >90% conviction threshold today beyond BITF.
